CS441 Project 1

This is a simple hello world program. It starts off with a screen of one
of Apple's original iOS backgrounds, a picture of Earth captured from
outer space. There is an image of a popular meme that is serves as a button
and text on top that says "Hello World". When you click the button, the
screen changes to a picture of the lovely Professor Madden. The text changes
to saying he loves two of his most favorite things in the world, Java and Android.
You can toggle back and forth between these two screens. There was no particular
reason I chose to do this. I just thought it would be funny. Haha.
